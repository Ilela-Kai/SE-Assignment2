# SE-Assignment2
# For this assignment, I already had my own github account, as well as git-bash downloaded.
# I configured Git, made a repository, and an initial commit.
# After I made my first commit, I created two branches. The first one being feature-1 and the second being feature2
# In feature-1, I had altered the original hello world sentence
# In feature2, I altered my hello world sentence as well
# After altering both branches, I then used pull requests, to make have them both added to the repository


# Looking at some of the problems that I had while navigating github was primarily with the syntax that I had to use on git-bash. Never using git-bash, and linux, I had to do a lot of research on the internet in order to make sure that everything that I was editing was being pushed/pulled into the repository. 

# As I reflect on github, and git-bash, I can really see the benefits of using this. Being able to actively look at all the changes being made, being able to make different branches, that you can either push into the repository, or just run to see if it will run in general. The benefits of github seem to be endless.
